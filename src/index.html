    <p class="info">I am currently enrolled at Nashville Software School. My past has nothing to do with computers. I have
      been in steel automotive manufacturing for most of my career. I operated large industrial machines
      that stamped, cut and formed flat-rolled steel into parts for cars. I enjoyed that type of work, however I wanted to
      use my brain more than my body. I started looking into CNC machine programming to go along with the type of work that I was doing.
      I started watching videos and researching to gain some knowledge. Through my research I came to realize that software development would be challenging, rewarding and a life-long journey of learning. I love learning new things and I pour myself into it. My passion for software development is only hampered by the hours in a day that I have to learn. The greatest part about development is that it is in a team environment. I seem to come alive during group projects and enjoy the many different ways that others approach the same problems.</p>
